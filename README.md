# MU627A
Submission for MU627A. Thesis for partial fulfilment for the degree of Master of Science.

This repo contains folders for several opcodes, including oscillators implementing SIMD AVX instructions for Csound as well as a folder
containing working protoype projects that were later implemented into the three AVX opcodes. 

Each opcode folder contains a source file, compiled .dll file, and a .csd file for testing the opcode.
